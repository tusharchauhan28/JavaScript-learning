Q. What is Data Type in JS and How many types ?

A data type defines the kind of value a variable can hold. It determines what operations can be performed on that value and how it is stored in memory.
JavaScript has two main categories of data types:-
1. Primitive Data Types:
2. Non-Primitive Data Types (Reference Types):


1. Primitive Data Types: Primitive data types are the most basic data types. They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once created. 
Any operation on a primitive type returns a new value rather than modifying the original value.

JavaScript has 7 primitive data types:
   Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
   String: Represents textual data, enclosed in single or double quotes.
   Boolean: Represents logical values, either true or false.
   Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
   Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
   Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as object keys.
   BigInt: Represents integers with arbitrary precision (larger than the Number type can handle).

2. Non-Primitive Data Types (Reference Types): Non-primitive data types, also known as reference types, are more complex. 
They are mutable and their values can be changed after creation. Non-primitive types are objects and are stored as references.

   Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
   Array: Represents an ordered list of values.
   Function: Represents a block of reusable code.
   Date: Represents dates and times.
   RegExp: Represents regular expressions.
   Map: Collection of keyed data items, similar to an object but with any type of keys.
   Set: Collection of unique values.
